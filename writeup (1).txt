Julia McCarthy and Frank (Tre) Gonzales

Exercise 1

Question 1:
Due to the fact that the from clause contains 3 relations(tables), we believe there would be numFields in S1 * numFields in S2 * numFields in E LogicalJoinNodes.

Because there are 3 aliased tables, there will be 3 LogicalScanNodes.

Because there are 3 filters specified in the where clause, there will be 3 LogicalFilterNodes.

Question 2:
The return type of physicalPlan() is DbIterator because it needs to give us the output fields and output types that we are to traverse through and filter.  A DbIterator is an easy way to give us all this information at once. 

Question 3: 

It seems that each entry in the subPlanMap represents the table we are filtering through (identified by its alias).

Writeup:

We have not made any changes to the API. We worked together on all aspects of the code even though Frank (Tre) got a girlfriend from Scripps and sometimes has less time to spend on code but thatâ€™s ok. We spend about 16 hours total on this assignment. OrderJoins was hard because we needed to use a lot auxiliary methods that we were not familiar with, but it was satisfying in the end.
